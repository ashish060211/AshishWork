mvn clean package 

mvn clean package docker:build : This command will work same as above but we can keep docker plugin in a separate profile called docker so that when we run mvn clean package it would not execute docker build. Right now we do have separate profile and in last step docker-maven-plugin executes docker build. It first copy docker file and jar to docker folder. Then it run docker build command. 

docker images -a
By running above command we can see our image. Our image name is mysvc which we define in <imageName> tag in pom file.

docker images -f dangling=true		
To see dangling images

docker ps -a 
To list all docker containers. 

docker container ls -a
To list all running docker containers.

docker rm <<container id>
To remove container.

docker system prune
This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all dangling build cache
  
docker image prune -a --filter "until=12h"
It will remove all images that are created more than 12 hours ago.

docker image rmi <<IMAGE ID>>  
To delete image

docker build -t mysvc target/docker
For separately building images we can use above command also.

docker run -d --name=mysvc -p 8100:8100 mysvc
docker ps
docker logs mysvc
curl http://$(boot2docker ip 2>/dev/null):8100
curl http://localhost:8100
